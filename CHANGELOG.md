## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-13

### Fixed
- `lint_steering`: `hidden-instruction` no longer fires on a product name alone, such as a comment that mentions Claude Code or a URL that contains "claude". Fixes [#2](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools/issues/2).
- `lint_steering`: `duplicate-rule` compares whole list items and sentences and skips markup-only lines such as `</details>`, so wrapped lines and closing tags are no longer duplicates. Fixes [#3](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools/issues/3).
- Guard hook: the trailing-whitespace check names the exact lines, and of two identical lines reports only the one that loses its trailing spaces. Fixes [#4](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools/issues/4).
- `claude plugin install asitis@asitis` no longer prints "2 userConfig options not yet set". The guard mode and the footer are now set with `ASITIS_GUARD_MODE` and `ASITIS_MCP_FOOTER` in the `env` block of Claude Code settings.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- `@asitis/mcp` 0.1.0: stdio MCP server with five read-only tools (`read_markdown`, `outline`, `lint_steering`, `context_budget`, `find_steering_files`), root confinement, a markdown-only allowlist, size caps, a per-call time budget and linear-time scanners.
- Claude Code plugin `asitis` 0.1.0: the server vendored and pinned by SHA-256 and started under Node's permission model, the `markdown-byte-clean` skill, `/asitis:md-lint`, `/asitis:md-budget` and an optional accident guard hook.
- Repository-level Claude Code marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- CI on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows, and a manual release workflow for npm trusted publishing with provenance.
- MIT licence.
