# AsItIs for Claude Code

**Keep markdown and agent steering files byte-clean.** From [AsItIs](https://asitis.app/?ref=claude-plugin), the markdown editor that never rewrites your file. Nothing changes unless you change it.

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| MCP server `asitis` | Six read-only tools: `read_markdown`, `outline`, `lint_steering`, `context_budget`, `find_steering_files`, `suggest_fixes`. See [`@asitis/mcp`](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools/blob/main/packages/mcp/README.md). |
| Skill `markdown-byte-clean` | Teaches Claude to edit minimal ranges, never rewrite whole markdown files, and keep frontmatter, line endings, BOM and trailing spaces exactly as they are. |
| `/asitis:md-lint [path] [skills] [config]` | Lints steering files: frontmatter on line 1, YAML, required fields, limits, broken links and `@imports`, invisible characters, hidden instructions, and drift between AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and the other agents' files. Add `skills` to also scan the scripts in skill folders, and `config` to audit `.claude/settings.json` and the MCP config files. |
| `/asitis:md-budget [path]` | Shows approximately how many tokens load every session, per tool, and what to cut. |
| `/asitis:md-fix [path]` | Shows mechanical fixes (invisible characters, frontmatter, skill names, trailing spaces, final newline) as a diff, asks, and applies only the ones you accept. |
| Guard hook (optional) | Warns before a Write, Edit or MultiEdit that would change line endings, strip trailing spaces that make a line break, drop a BOM or break frontmatter in an existing markdown file. |
| `asitis` CLI | The same linter for scripts and CI, bundled at `server/asitis.mjs`: `node server/asitis.mjs lint`. See [CLI and CI](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools#cli-and-ci). |

## Install

Requires Claude Code and Node 22.13 or later on your `PATH` (the server and hook run with `node`).

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Katta041/asitis-agent-tools
claude plugin install asitis@asitis
```

Inside a session, `/plugin marketplace add Katta041/asitis-agent-tools` and `/plugin install asitis@asitis` do the same. Then start a new session and run `/asitis:md-lint` to lint the project's steering files, or `/asitis:md-budget` to see what they cost in tokens.

To update, run `claude plugin marketplace update asitis`, then `claude plugin update asitis@asitis`, and restart Claude Code. To remove it, run `claude plugin uninstall asitis@asitis`.

From a local clone of [the repository](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools), pass the clone's folder instead: `claude plugin marketplace add ./asitis-agent-tools`. To try it for one session without installing, run `claude --plugin-dir ./asitis-agent-tools/plugins/asitis`.

For other assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI), use the MCP server on its own; config snippets are in the [repository README](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools#other-mcp-clients-claude-desktop-cursor-codex-gemini-cli).

### Troubleshooting

| You see | What to do |
|---|---|
| `asitis-mcp: AsItIs needs Node 22.13 or later; you have 20.18.0. ...` | Install a current Node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and restart Claude Code. (Run without the plugin's launcher, older Node prints only `node: bad option: --permission`.) |
| `asitis-mcp: Refusing your home folder ...` | Start Claude Code in a project folder, not in your home folder. |
| `asitis-mcp: Node's permission model will not let the server read the root folder ...` | Only when you run the server by hand: list the project folder in `--allow-fs-read` and drop any folder inside it. The plugin does this for you. |

## Privacy

- No network. The server and the hook make no connections, collect nothing and send nothing.
- No writes. The server has no write tool and no write code; the hook only reads the file it is asked about. `/asitis:md-fix` edits a file only after you accept the fix, through Claude's own Edit tool.
- Markdown only, unless you ask. `/asitis:md-lint` reads steering files and `.asitisrc.json`. With `skills` it also reads the scripts in skill folders; with `config` it reads `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json` and `.gemini/settings.json`. `.claude/settings.local.json` needs `config-local`, and `~/.claude.json` is never read. A repo's `.asitisrc.json` cannot turn these scans on for you.
- The server runs under Node's permission model: `node --permission` with read access to this plugin and your project folder only, and no write or child-process rights. Node enforces that, not just our code. Node blocks network access too from version 25; on Node 22.13 to 24 the no-network guarantee rests on the code, which contains no network calls. A small launcher (`server/launch.mjs`, about 110 lines, no dependencies) checks the Node version and starts the server with those flags; it reads no files and makes no connections.
- Tool results go into Claude's context and so reach Anthropic like the rest of your session. That is Claude Code's traffic, not ours.

## Pinned server

The server is not fetched from npm at runtime. `server/asitis-mcp.mjs` is the exact `@asitis/mcp` build for this plugin version (one file, zero dependencies), `server/asitis.mjs` is the CLI from the same build, and `server/VERSION` records the version and both SHA-256 values. A test fails if the file differs from a fresh build or if the versions disagree. [`server/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/Katta041/asitis-agent-tools/blob/main/plugins/asitis/server/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) lists the bundled open-source licences.

## Guard hook

**The guard is an accident guard, not a security boundary.** It exists to catch the common accident: an agent rewrites a whole file with `Write`, or an `Edit` whose `new_string` quietly drops trailing spaces or CRLF line endings. It checks `Write`, `Edit` and `MultiEdit` on existing `.md`, `.mdc`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules` and `.clinerules` files and warns when the change would:

- convert CRLF to LF (or the reverse), flatten mixed line endings or remove lone CRs;
- strip trailing whitespace that can be a hard line break (two or more spaces with more paragraph text on the next line), any trailing whitespace in fenced code or frontmatter, including on a line whose words also change;
- remove the BOM with an `Edit`, add a BOM, or drop the final newline (Claude Code's `Write` keeps an existing BOM, so a `Write` without one is fine);
- move the frontmatter off line 1, remove its closing `---`, drop keys or indent it with tabs;
- rewrite much of an existing file: with `Write`, more than 30% of its lines (at least 3 lines); with `Edit` or `MultiEdit`, more than half (at least 5 lines). Lines count as kept only if they stay in the same order, so a reordered file counts as rewritten;
- touch a file with invalid UTF-8 bytes, which a text tool will replace.

It does not ask about whitespace that cannot change how the file renders: a single trailing space, trailing tabs, spaces on an otherwise blank line or at the end of a paragraph, and adding a missing final newline. Those are the safe fixes `/asitis:md-fix` applies, so accepting them takes one answer, not two.

It checks an `Edit` or `MultiEdit` the way Claude Code writes it: Claude Code turns CRLF into LF, applies the edit, and writes every line break back in one style picked from the first 4,096 characters of the file. So a one-word `Edit` to a file with mixed line endings rewrites all of them, and so does any `Edit` to a CRLF file whose first 4,096 characters have no line break. The guard warns about that and tells Claude to ask you, because no `Edit` can avoid it.

What it does not do: it does not see `Bash` (`sed -i`, redirects, scripts), `NotebookEdit`, other tools or other programs, and anything running as you can bypass it. It never changes the tool call.

Modes, set with the environment variable `ASITIS_GUARD_MODE` (see Options below):

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `ask` (default) | Shows the warning and asks you to allow or reject the change. |
| `deny` | Blocks the change and tells Claude to retry with a minimal edit. |
| `off` | Disabled. |

Any other value is treated as `deny`, the safest mode, and the guard says so in its message.

It fails closed:

- If the hook input is not valid JSON or lacks the fields it needs, the change is blocked with a one-line message saying why (`AsItIs guard: the hook input is not valid JSON. The change was blocked to be safe; ...`).
- Claude Code gives the hook 10 seconds and lets the change through if a hook times out. The guard therefore stops itself after 6 seconds (counted from when the hook process starts), and on files over 16 MB, and asks you (blocks in `deny` mode) instead of letting an unchecked change through.

One case it cannot cover: Claude Code starts the guard with `node`. If `node` is not on your `PATH`, or is older than Node 12, the guard cannot run and Claude Code lets the change through. The plugin's server needs Node 22.13 or later anyway, so with a working plugin the guard runs too.

In a headless run (`claude -p`) Claude Code treats an "ask" as a denial and may label it "hook error". The guard's message starts with "AsItIs guard flagged this change on purpose (a guard decision, not a failure)" so the reason is clear.

Set `ASITIS_GUARD_MODE` to `off` if that ever gets in your way.

## Options

The plugin works with no setup, so installing it asks nothing. To change a default, set an environment variable in the `env` block of your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`, or `.claude/settings.local.json` for one project), then start a new session:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ASITIS_GUARD_MODE": "deny"
  }
}
```

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ASITIS_GUARD_MODE` | `ask` | `ask`, `deny` or `off` for the guard hook. |
| `ASITIS_MCP_FOOTER` | off | Set to `1` to end the first tool result of each session with one line linking to asitis.app. Before 0.2.5 this line was on by default. |

Before 0.2.1 these were plugin options (`guard_mode`, `footer`) set with `/plugin configure`. Claude Code reports every plugin option the user has not saved as "not yet set" at install, even one with a default, so 0.2.1 reads environment variables instead. If you set either option, set the variable instead.

## Develop
